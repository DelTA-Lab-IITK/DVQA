\begin{itemize}
    \item We adopt an exemplar based approach to improve visual question answering (VQA) methods by providing a differential attention
    \item We evaluate two variants for obtaining differential attention - one where we only obtain attention and the other where we obtain differential context in addition to attention
    \item We show that this method correlates better with human attention and results in an improved visual question answering that improves the state-of-the-art for image based attention methods. It is also competitive with respect to other proposed methods for this problem.
\end{itemize}
